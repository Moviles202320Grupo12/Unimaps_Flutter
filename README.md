## Home View for Lost Objects

The Home View serves as the central hub for viewing all lost objects. It displays a grid of items that have been reported as lost. Each item is represented by a card that includes essential details like the object's name and location. The grid is scrollable, allowing users to browse through an extensive list of lost items.
