## Home View for Lost Objects

The Home View serves as the central hub for viewing all lost objects. It displays a grid of items that have been reported as lost. Each item is represented by a card that includes essential details like the object's name and location. The grid is scrollable, allowing users to browse through an extensive list of lost items.

## Specific Lost Object View

This view provides detailed information about a specific lost object. Similar to the Home View, it is designed for ease of use and navigation. Users can scroll through the page to view more details, such as the object's description, the location where it was found, and other relevant information.

## Report Lost Object View

The Report Lost Object View is designed for users to report new lost items. It features a user-friendly interface with fields for entering details about the lost object. These fields include placeholders for uploading an image of the object, as well as text fields for entering the object's name, location, and description. Once all the required information is entered, users can publish the report by clicking the "Publish" button.
